        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Regional dishes are often a source of dispute among Italians, whether they are professional chefs or amateur chefs, and spaghetti all'Amatriciana is no exception! Bucatini or spaghetti, bacon or guanciale, garlic or onion... these are the main questions that anyone preparing this recipe for the first time has to face. It is said that this famous dish, created in Amatrice, was the main meal of its shepherds, but originally it was made without tomatoes and was called "gricia"; tomatoes were added later when they were imported from the Americas and the sauce took on the name Amatriciana. It is therefore to be expected that such an ancient and popular recipe was transformed over time, taking on the many variations that are still discussed today. What we propose here is our version, prepared with local and op quality ingredients. We are convinced that the recipe for Spaghetti Amatriciana (spaghetti with tomato and bacon) does not divide Italy, but rather unites it in the name of the goodness of a dish with a simple soul and a strong character... just like those who created it!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>320 g Spaghetti (in my picture I used linguine)</li>
            <li>150 g Guanciale</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
            <li>Fresh chili pepper (I used chili flakes)</li>
            <li>400 g peeled tomatoes</li>
            <li>75 g Pecorino Romano DOP cheese (for grating)</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
            <li>50 ml white wine</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>To prepare spaghetti Amatriciana (spaghetti with tomato and bacon), first boil the water to cook the pasta in, then add salt. Prepare the sauce: take the guanciale, remove the pork rind and cut it into slices about 1/4-inch (1 cm) thick then into strips about 1/8-inch (1/2 cm) wide</li>
            <li>Heat a drizzle of oil in a pan, preferably a stainless steel skillet, add the whole chili pepper and the guanciale cut into strips; brown over low heat for 7-8 min until the fat has melted and the meat is crunchy; stir often to prevent it from burning. Once the fat has melted, pour in the white wine, turn up the heat and let it evaporate.</li>
            <li>Transfer the guanciale to a plate and set aside, pour the peeled tomatoes into the same pan, breaking them up with your hands directly into the cooking liquid, continue cooking the sauce for about 10 minutes. As soon as the water boils, pour in the spaghetti and cook them al dente.</li>
            <li>Add salt to taste, remove the chili pepper from the sauce, add the guanciale strips to the pan and stir to mix.</li>
            <li>Once the spaghetti are cooked, drain them and add them directly to the sauce in the pan. Saut√© the pasta very quickly to mix it well with the sauce. If you like the pasta al dente you can turn off the heat otherwise pour a little of the pasta cooking water to continue cooking. To finish, sprinkle with grated pecorino cheese: your spaghetti all'Amatriciana is ready to be served!</li>
