        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Jambalaya is a staple dish of c
            Cajun cuisine. There are many variants of it but the classic variant includes green bell pepper, onion and celery as its base also known as the <strong>"holy trinity"</strong>. Other ingredients are andouille sausage, shrimp and chicken. In our recipe we will be using chorizo as a substitute for andouille, because many times it is not available. Actually any smoked sausage will do.
